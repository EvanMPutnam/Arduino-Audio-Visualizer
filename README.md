# Arduino-Audio-Visualizer
This is a project I worked on to visualize audio with an LED strip.  


## Pre-reqs
### Python
* PyAudio library.  You may need to install port audio on your platform as the library uses this.
* Scipy and Numpy.  Handles all the mathy related stuff...
* PySerial.  This is to interface with the arduino
### Arduino
* FastLED library
* An LED light strip that is supported by the FastLED library.
